# Sparta
 Sports Management Facility

This project implements a Sports Facility Management System using Python and the CustomTkinter library. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing bookings of various sports facilities.

### Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
* **GUI Library:** CustomTkinter ([https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter))
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The code adheres to OOP principles for better maintainability and scalability.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

* **main.py:** The main script containing the application logic and user interface creation.
* **images (optional):** This folder can store any images used in the application (e.g., logos, icons).
* **customtkinter and other utility packages:** This folder can contain utility functions used throughout the project. I faced an error when directly install, so I cloned the package. Similarly for darkdetect and packaging.

### Running the Application

1. Ensure you have Python 3 and CustomTkinter installed. You can install CustomTkinter using `pip install customtkinter`.
2. Clone the repository, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the application using `python main.py`.
